    <h3>  Career</h3>
    <div> Roger Federer (born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional tennis player, currently ranked world No. 2 in men's
      singles tennis by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). Federer has won 20 Grand Slam singles
      titles-the most in history for a male player-and has held the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for a record
      total of 310 weeks, including a record 237 consecutive weeks. After turning professional in 1998, he was
      continuously ranked in the top ten from October 2002 to November 2016. He re-entered the top ten following his
      victory at the 2017 Australian Open.</div>

    <p> Federer has won a record eight Wimbledon titles, a joint-record six Australian Open titles, a record
      five consecutive US Open titles, and one French Open title. He is one of eight men to have achieved a career
      Grand Slam. Federer has reached a record 30 men's singles Grand Slam finals, including 10 in a row from the
      2005 Wimbledon Championships to the 2007 US Open. Federer has also won a record six ATP Finals, 27 ATP World
      Tour Masters 1000 titles, and a record 20 ATP World Tour 500 titles.</p>

    <p> Federer's all-court game and versatile style of play involve exceptional footwork and shot-making. Effective
      both as a base-liner and a volleyer, his apparent effortlessness and efficient movement on the court have made
      Federer highly popular among his fans. He has received the tour Sportsmanship Award 13 times and been
      named the ATP Player of the Year and ITF World Champion five times. He has won the Laureus World Sportsman of
      the Year award a record five times, including four consecutive awards from 2005 to 2008. He is also the only
      individual to have won the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year award four times.</p>
